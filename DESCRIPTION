Description: This package does many methods on sparse numeric vectors. A sparse 
  numeric vector is a vector where the majority of the elements are zero. It has 
  three slots, value, which is the numeric vector containing all the non-zero 
  elements, pos, an integer vector containing the index positions of non-zero 
  elements, and length, which is the overall length of the vector including zero
  elements. The methods included are addition, subtraction, multiplication,
  cross-multiplication and division on sparse numeric vectors. There is also 
  methods of the mean, normalization and standardization.
